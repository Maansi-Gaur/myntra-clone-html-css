# Myntra Clone

This is a simple Myntra homepage clone that I built using HTML and CSS to practice my frontend skills.

I tried to recreate the layout, navbar, banner section, and product categories similar to the original website. The main focus of this project was improving my understanding of CSS positioning and layout structure.

## What I Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

## What I Learned

- How to structure a real-world website layout
- Better understanding of flexbox
- How spacing and alignment affect UI
- Writing cleaner and more organized CSS

## How to Run

Just download the project and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Future Improvements

- Make it fully responsive
- Add hover effects
- Add JavaScript for more functionality


This is a practice project made for learning purposes.
